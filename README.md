# StarChain

StarChain is a lightweight, scalable blockchain solution built using Golang, designed to provide a robust framework for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts. StarChain aims to deliver high performance, security, and easy integration for developers looking to build on a distributed ledger platform.

## Features

- **Modular Architecture**: StarChain is designed with modular components, making it easy to customize and extend for specific use cases.
- **Consensus Mechanism**: Utilizes [insert consensus algorithm, e.g., Proof of Stake (PoS) or Proof of Work (PoW)] to ensure network security and decentralization.
- **Smart Contracts**: Fully supports smart contract deployment and execution using a custom-built virtual machine.
- **API Integration**: Provides a simple RESTful API for easy integration with external applications and services.
- **Cross-Platform**: Can be deployed on multiple environments, including cloud-based services or on-premises servers.
- **Lightweight Nodes**: Supports lightweight nodes to participate in the network without requiring extensive storage or processing power.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Go**: You need to have Go installed on your system. You can install it from [here](https://golang.org/doc/install).
- **Git**: Make sure you have Git installed for version control.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/starchain.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd starchain
   ```

3. Install the necessary Go dependencies:

   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

4. Build the project:

   ```bash
   go build
   ```

### Usage

To start a new StarChain node, use the following command:

```bash
./starchain --start-node
```

You can specify different parameters for the node such as port, IP address, or peer discovery by using the appropriate flags:

```bash
./starchain --start-node --port=8080 --ip=127.0.0.1
```

To deploy a smart contract, use the following API call:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/contract/deploy -d '{"contract_code": "<code>", "gas_limit": 1000}'
```

### Configuration

StarChain uses a simple configuration file to manage node settings, consensus parameters, and API integrations. You can modify the `config.json` file to suit your network requirements:

```json
{
  "network": "starchain",
  "node_id": "node_1",
  "consensus": "PoS",
  "api_port": 8080
}
```

### Running Tests

Run the unit tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly:

```bash
go test ./...
```

### Roadmap

- [ ] Implement support for smart contract testing environments.
- [ ] Add staking and governance features.
- [ ] Improve network scalability for high transaction volumes.
- [ ] Add multi-language support for smart contract development.
